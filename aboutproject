                     This is a simple number geussing game that i create by using c++ programming language.

           It begins by welcoming the player and prompting them to choose a difficulty level (easy, medium, difficult) or to exit. 
           Depending on the chosen level,
            the player is asked to enter a range for the randomly generated number they need to guess. 
            The game then initiates a loop where the player has a limited number of attempts to guess the correct number within the specified range.
             After each guess, the program provides feedback on whether the guess was correct, too high, or too low. 
             If the player runs out of attempts without guessing correctly, they lose the game.

             In this project I used function srand to create random right number ,
             If that Right number is equal to the Playerchoice(userinput),means player win the game.
             In either low or guess game and the number of attemps (leftchoice==0),you have lost the game.

             This is simple but a entertaining game. Hope you like.
